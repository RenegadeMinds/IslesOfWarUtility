X (i.e. 0-7) Represents combinations of collectors, resources, or bunkers.
Y (i.e. )-A) Represents single representations like, land or blocker types.

Land Tiles (features):
	0-7 = Hills
	a-h = Lakes
	A-H = Mountains
	
Blockers (defenses):
	Any character in  ) row  = No blocker
	Any character in  0 row  = Troop blocker
	Any character in  a row  = Tank blocker
	Any character in  A row  = Aircraft blocker
	
Bunkers (defenses):
	),0,a,A = No bunkers
	!,1,b,B = Troop bunker
	@,2,c,C = Tank bunker
	#,3,d,D = Air bunker
	$,4,e,E = Troop and Tank bunker
	%,5,f,F = Troop and Air bunker
	^,6,g,G = Tank and Air bunker
	&,7,h,H = Not valid bunker combo only 2 bunkers allowed.
	
Resources (defenses):
	0 = No collectors
	1 = Oil collectors
	2 = Metal collectors
	3 = Concrete collectors
	4 = Oil and Metal collectors
	5 = Oil and Concrete collectors
	6 = Metal and Concrete collectors
	7 = All collector types
	
Any arrays dealing with resources are ALWAYS in order of oil, metal, concrete.
Resources in the isalnds are extraction times, not the total amount of resources in the tile. So currently the extraction rate is 10, so just multiply the resources by 10.
